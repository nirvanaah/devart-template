So, 
  
Pseudo-code again:
```
  if (face_detection == true) {
    // Grab the pixels that are at the border of the persons face and increase their size.
    // Now we have a selfie, where the border of the persons face are just big pixels that match their skin tone, hair color, and maybe, some jewlery.
    }
```
