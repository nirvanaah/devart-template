Perception plays a big role here.

Relative to us, we can see the image of a big tree that's very close up.

However, relative to the little boy in the picture, the tree is very far.

This contrast, in my opinion, really stimulates the mind. 

Moreover, the final product would be this whole scene of perception, inside of a selfie, your selfie. Pixelated. That's cool.
