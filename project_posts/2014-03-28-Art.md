Creating images, like Salvador Dali's painting of Abraham Lincoln using technology isn't impossible. It just takes alot of analyzation and creativity to produce something that it's meaningful but at the same time, interesting. Making an Android app for this is definitely possible, and that is my goal for this project. So that everyone can make unique, and meaningful art for themselves.
