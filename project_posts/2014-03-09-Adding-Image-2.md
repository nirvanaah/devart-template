Okay, so, we chose to put a the picture of a little boy(possibly a baby picture of yourself) at the top of our forehead giving the perception that he is far far away by scaling the image to a small small size. 

Now, we take another image, say for example the picture of a pear tree and make it big and put him at the bottom of our face near our chin area (opposite values of Image1, if you haven't noticed).
