Okay, so the first thing that we wil need to do is to check if the person submitted a real "selfie" or self-portrait.

  In pseudo-code: 
    
      // User uploads an image
      
      // We check if this is a real selfie or not ... by detecting if a face exists.
      
        if (face_detection == true) {
            //Do more stuff...
          }
        else {
            console.log("sorry pal, this is not a selfi3..");
          }
