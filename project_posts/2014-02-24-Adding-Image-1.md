Now, what we do is grab an picture and we will call it Image1.

We can either put Image1 at the top or bottom and make it small or big.

So: 

```
Image1 = (TOP||BOTTOM && SMALL||BIG)
```

Alright!


Say the user chose to put Image1 at the top and decided to make it small...

and lets say that Image1 is a picture of a boy.

So after we layer it with our selfie, it will look like a little boy is at the top of our forehead however, is far far away because we scale the size of image1(the pictures with the boy) to a small size.
