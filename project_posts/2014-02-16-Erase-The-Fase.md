Alright, so now, we have an OBSCURE selfie that's different from all other selfies. However, it is still not yet fully complete. Now, we have to erase whatever is inside the border of the fase(face, haha) and make it transparent.

```
function erase_the_fase(thefase) {
// Takes the image and makes whatever is inside the pixelated-border of the face transparent.
}
```
