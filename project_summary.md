## Description
To be honest, using the most complex algorithim to create an image of a frog in 3D isn't what art is about, that's something to do if you want to melt your computer. Art is something that you look at that captivates your imagination. It's something that you look at that has more than just a superficial meaning. It's something that you look at that allows you to leap through the bounds of time, taking you to the past, maybe even the future, or an alternate dimension. It's the closest thing to a black hole. After looking at some of Salvador Dali's work, it came to me that his Abraham Lincoln painting is something that truly grabs the essence of a self portrait. I want to create an app for Android where people can take a picture of themselves, and automatically have it turn into art, like Salvador Dali's painting of Abraham Lincoln.
